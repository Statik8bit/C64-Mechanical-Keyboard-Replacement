# C64-Mechanical-Keyboard-Replacement
My version of a full mechanical keyboard replacement, including a mechanical shift lock

I've attached the Solidworks files use to create the STLs as well as the STLs themselves.  
I printed the Keyboard support with the longest dimension in the Z axis with no supports on my Creality CR-10 in PLA with a larger brim for stability and 20% infill.

The key adapters printed OK in PLA I had to print them on a raft to get them to work.  This leaves a less than flat bottom, some post processing will be needed with PLA.

Questions or requests for help can be sent to statik8bitcomputer@gmail.com, I'll admit that I'm not the best seeing all my email.  Please be patient with me.

I am working on a build guid that will be posted on my website, www.statik8bitcomputer.com.
